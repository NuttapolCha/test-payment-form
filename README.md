### Deadline: 8 July 2022 at 18:00 (1 week)

### Requirements

Develop Web App for Ecommerce & E-Receipt Feature.

User need to submit these information to checkout;

- Firstname

- Expire Date
- CVV

The App should have data validation if user input the form incorrectly.

### Tech Stack

- Next.js (Frontend React.js Framework) for frontend
- Nest.js (Backend TS Framework) for backend
- PostgreSQL for Database

## Solution

### Prerequisite

- node
- docker

### Getting Start

This service can be simply started by the following steps.

1. Start postgreSQL docker

```sh
$make start-pg
```

2. Initialize database and schema

```sh
$make reset-pg
```

3. Run the service locally

```sh
$make dev
```

From now on, the service should be started.

Once you have stopped the service, you may also stop the postgreSQL docker by simply run

```sh
$make stop-pg
```

### Limitation

1. No duplicate coupons validation.
2. There is no product tables. We just assume that users were buying only *Annual Subscription*.
